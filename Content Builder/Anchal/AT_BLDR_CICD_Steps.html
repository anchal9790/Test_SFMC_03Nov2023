You will publish and you will see, the code which you edited in VS, synced with dropbox and then got called at SFMC<br>12. The best part of this whole solution is that you don't need to wait for code changes to reflect in SFMC cloudpages. You make some changes in VS and it immediately gets reflected in cloudpage as soon as you publish<br><br> Thank you for reading </b>")
